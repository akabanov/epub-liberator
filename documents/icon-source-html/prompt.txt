Create two HTML files for Flutter app icons (1024x1024px each):

File 1: icon-full.html (Full Version for bigger icons)

Canvas:
White background
1024x1024px dark grey square in center with gradient (darker bottom-right: #4a4a4a to #2d2d2d)
Square edges (no rounded corners)
No shadows around the square
`book_outline.png` image as a background (I'll place it next to the html)

Content (centered within front book):
Wrench icon in sage green (#b8d4b8) - large, prominent, side marging 280, top margin 210 px
subtle drop shadow

File 2: icon-small.html (for smaller icons generation, for example for browser tabs)
Same canva, but without the book

Content:
Only the wrench icon (no text, no background image, same shape as before, but must fill the space with only 15% margins, all sides)
Wrench in sage green (#b8d4b8), centered, very large

Key Requirements:
Use icon fonts for both wrench (styled like iOS/Cupertino wrench) and book outlines
Clean, modern, minimalist design
Book outlines should clearly frame the content and look like actual books
Professional app icon aesthetic
