# EPUB Fixer for Kobo

Some e-readers apply formatting rules embedded in digital books that override
your personal reading preferences. This is particularly problematic with Kobo
devices and Adobe Digital Editions, which strictly prioritize the publisher's
formatting over your chosen settings for text size, spacing, and alignment. This
app removes those embedded formatting instructions, restoring control over how
your books display on your device.
